# Rotate 2D Matrix

This project is about rotating a given n x n 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise in place.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8.10
- No external modules are allowed
- Code should follow pycodestyle (version 2.8.0)
- The matrix will always be a non-empty 2D list

## Usage

To test the matrix rotation, run:

```bash
./main_0.py
